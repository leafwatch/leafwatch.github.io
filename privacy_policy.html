    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date: 2024-09-07</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the data handling practices of LeafWatch ("we," "our," or "us"). We value your privacy and are committed to ensuring that your personal information remains secure. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding the information you provide.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>LeafWatch does not collect or store any personal information, except for photos that users optionally select to use within the app. No other data, such as your location, contacts, or device information, is collected.</p>

    <h2>3. Photos</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The app only accesses photos that you explicitly choose to upload for use within the app's features.</li>
        <li>These selected photos are transmitted to our secure servers for processing.</li>
        <li>Once processing is complete, the photos are either stored temporarily or deleted from our servers according to the specified retention period [Insert Retention Period if applicable]. We do not access or store any other photos from your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information, including the photos you select, to third parties. The photos you upload are solely used for processing within the app's features and are not shared with any external entities.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your photos seriously and use industry-standard security measures, including encryption, to protect data during transmission to our servers and while stored on our systems. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so while we strive to protect your photos, we cannot guarantee their absolute security.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Photos uploaded to our servers are retained for the minimum period necessary to complete the processing task. After this, the photos are either deleted or anonymized based on our data retention policy.</p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>You retain full control over the photos you select to use within the app. If you wish to delete any uploaded photos, you can do so by contacting us at [contact information], and we will ensure they are permanently removed from our servers.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in an updated version of the policy and communicated to users through the app. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@leafwatch.ai</p>

    <p>By using LeafWatch, you acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
